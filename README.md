# Parlier-NJROTC's backend server

Welcome to the backend server source code
for now this server is for the ribbon system

## Setup

### Initializing Project

Since this project uses bun, run the command: sudo bun install
This will install all packages

If you are using node or deno some how, copy the code and package.json
Run the equivalant of sudo bun install (sudo npm install or what ever deno uses)
No idea how it will run so any errors, you try to figure them out.

### Error Handleing

if an error happens when editing (Mac):

1. go to the parent folder of this folder in FINDER
2. right click the folder and select "open terminal at folder"
3. run this command: sudo chown -R "Your Username-Here" "Parent Folder"

If you are on windows, linux, or another os (idk templeOS if you somehow are a programming god)
google it

## Where do I start?

The index.ts, is where the code will start running,
all your knowledge of nodejs will transfer here.

.ts is typescript aka javascript with types
